## Architecture Workflow
1. **Core Module**:  
   - Centralizes `ApiClient` (Dio + interceptors), `AppRouter` (GoRouter), `LocationService`, and `Analytics`.  
   - Uses `GetIt` for dependency injection across modules.  
2. **Feature Modules**:  
   - Each feature (e.g., `restaurant_catalog`, `live_tracking`) is a standalone Flutter package.  
   - State management with **BLoC** or **Riverpod** depending on complexity.  
3. **Role-Based Apps**:  
   - Build separate customer and driver apps by composing modules.
4. **Real-Time Sync**:  
   - Use **Cloud Firestore real-time listeners** for live order/delivery updates.
